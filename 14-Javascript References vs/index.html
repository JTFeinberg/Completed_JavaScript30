      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const team = players
      console.log({ players, team })
      // however what happens when we update that array?
      team[3] = 'John'
      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice()

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players)

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players]

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      team2[3] = 'Jan'
      team3[3] = 'Michael'

      const person = {

        age: 80
      }

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person
      captain.number = 99
      console.log(person)

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 55, number: 30 })
      console.log(person, captain2)

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const captain3 = { ...person, name: 'Bambu' }
      console.log(person, captain3)

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
